A lucky ticket is a ticket whose number is such that the sum of the first half of the number is equal to the sum of the second half. Such numbers can be of any length. The only limitation is that the number of digits in the ticket number should be even. 

This mini-project implements an `isHappyTicket` function that can tell if a ticket is lucky or not.

```js
isHappyTicket('385916'); // true
isHappyTicket('231002'); // false
isHappyTicket('1222');   // false
isHappyTicket('054702'); // true
isHappyTicket('00');     // true
```
