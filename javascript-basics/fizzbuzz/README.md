This mini-project implements a `fizzBuzz` default function that receives the start value and the end value (inclusive) of a range of numbers and prints the range in the console following the following rules:

- Fizz if the number can can be divided by 3
- Buzz if the number can be divided by 5
- FizzBuzz if the number can be divided by both 3 and 5
- the number itself in all other cases

The input values are positive integers greater than zero. If the range is empty (begin > end), the function prints nothing.

```text
fizzBuzz(11, 20);
```
