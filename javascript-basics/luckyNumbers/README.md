Lucky is a number that can get converted to 1 using the sum of squares of its digits.
This mini-project implements an `isHappyNumber` function that can tell if a number is lucky or not.

For example, 7 is a lucky number.

```text
7   => 7^2 = 49,
49  => 4^2 + 9^2 = 16 + 81 = 97,
97  => 9^2 + 7^2 = 81 + 49 = 130,
130 => 1^2 + 3^2 + 0^2 = 10,
10  => 1^2 + 0^2 = 1.
```
